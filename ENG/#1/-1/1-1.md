## Abstract <br>
By default, when using the `input()` function in Python, the input is stored as a string (`str`).
Even if you intend for the input to be an integer (`int`) or a float, the interpreter recognizes it as a string.
 
This is a fundamental yet common mistake, so let's dive into this topic.

------------------------------------
## 1. Overview of input()

The `input()` function basically works as shown in the image below.

Since it needs to receive a prompt from the user, using the `input()` function will display an input request in the terminal or a window.

Let's try running the example code below.

```python
x = input('input = ')

print(f'x is {x}')
```

When executed, the following request appears.

The value of the assigned variable will change depending on the value entered in the window or terminal.

However, if we assign **x = 1** in the example code below and run it, something seems strange.

```python
x = input('input = ')

print(f'x is {x}')
print('x type is', type(x))

>>> x is 1
>>> x type is <class 'str'>
```

The type is shown as `str`.
Even though it printed `x is 1`, it's like trying to run something incompatible.

This isn't just a random analogy. For example, MacOS is a system that doesn't support PUBG. Since the system environments are different, 
running it is simply **'impossible'**. To the Python interpreter, `str` and `int` are data from completely different worlds.

So, let's experiment. Let's determine whether it's an `int` or a `str` using the following code.

```python
x = input('input = ')
y = 3
#print(f'x is {x}')
#print('x type is', type(x))
print(x + y)
```

When executed, you will encounter the following error:
`TypeError: can only concatenate str (not "int") to str`

It says the type of `x` is `str`, not `int`.
This is because `y` is the only integer in this code.

Let's solve this in the **Changing the input type** section.

## 2. Changing the input type 

As discussed earlier, even if you assign an **int** to `input()`, the prompt type is recognized as a **str**.
Let's change the type from `str` to **int** or **float**.

Let's enter the following code.

```python
x1 = input('x1 = ')
x2 = int(input('x2 = '))
x3 = float(input('x3 = '))

print(f'x1 is {x1}')
print(f'x2 is {x2}')
print(f'x3 is {x3}')

print('x1 type is', type(x1))
print('x2 type is', type(x2))
print('x3 type is', type(x3))

>>> x1 is 1
>>> x2 is 1
>>> x3 is 1.0
>>> x1 type is <class 'str'>
>>> x2 type is <class 'int'>
>>> x3 type is <class 'float'>
```

Let's recognize the difference. Where did the difference come from?

It seems to be this part:
>**int**(input())
>**float**(input())

Visualizing it looks like this:

If you use `input()` as is, the interpreter recognizes it in the following frame:

If you proceed with **int**(input()), it is recognized as follows:

![Image description](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/h9soyr97l342dyku7ttv.png)

As you can see in the picture, for `x1`, the assignment itself becomes **"1"**, making it a `str`, but for `x2`, it becomes **1**, which is an **int**.
Then, how is **float** recognized?

Let's look at the image below.
![Image description](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/hu7cysb0pwg0fjsyzoeg.png)

You can see it being assigned as **1.0**, which is a floating-point number, or **float**.

Now, let's use it in a calculation. We'll check if the same error we encountered earlier appears.

```python
x = int(input('input = '))
y = 3
#print(f'x is {x}')
#print('x type is', type(x))
print(x + y)

>>> 4
```

Assuming `x = 1`, you can see that the calculation is performed correctly.

Then, what result will we get if we proceed with `float`?
> A) 4.0
> B) 3.1

```python
x = float(input('input = '))
y = 3
#print(f'x is {x}')
#print('x type is', type(x))
print(x + y)

>>> 4.0
```
The following result is obtained. The answer was **A**.

Finally, let's calculate basic arithmetic operations using `input()`.

Ex1)
```python
x1 = int(input('input = '))
x2 = int(input('input = '))

print(f'x1 is {x1}')
print(f'x2 is {x2}')

print(x1 + x2)
print(x1 - x2)
print(x1 * x2)
print(x1 / x2)

>>> x1 is 10
>>> x2 is 5
>>> 15
>>> 5
>>> 50
>>> 2.0
```

Ex2)

```python
x1 = float(input('input = '))
x2 = float(input('input = '))

print(f'x1 is {x1}')
print(f'x2 is {x2}')

print(x1 + x2)
print(x1 - x2)
print(x1 * x2)
print(x1 / x2)

>>> x1 is 10.0
>>> x2 is 5.0
>>> 15.0
>>> 5.0
>>> 50.0
>>> 2.0
```

------------------------------------

## Conclusion

Python's `input()` function assigns all inputs as `str` by default. If you attempt numerical operations without understanding this characteristic, the system will immediately throw a `TypeError` and stop.

As we experimented earlier, the way to make this 'impossible operation' possible is clear.

> `int(input())`: When integer data is needed

> `float(input())`: When float data is needed

By specifying the desired type at the beginning of `input()`, you can finally convert an uncertain string into a valid number that can be controlled.
