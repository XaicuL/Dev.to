## 1. Who R Ü(ing-Be going to)

Nice to meet you. I'm Luciano.

The reason I started this tech blog is simple: our memory is limited, but by documenting my journey, I believe I can extend that limitation.

All posts on Dev.to will be written in Korean. However, considering the large English-speaking community there, I'll provide English versions through the link at the top. The format will remain identical—only the language changes. This way, I can share the same content consistently with everyone.

### 1-1. ing

I'm currently studying through MIT OpenCourseWare's [6.0001](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-0001-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-in-python-fall-2016/).

I also have a research idea related to mathematics and computing that I plan to submit to arXiv, and I'm working on that in parallel.

Lastly, there's a service I want to launch in South Korea, and I'm developing it independently.

If I were to prioritize: 6.0001 >>> research project > etc.

Apart from my 6.0001 code, you won't find the rest anywhere yet. I haven't unveiled them to the world.

### 1-2. Be going to

Here's my plan:

> MIT 6.0001 -> MIT 6.0002 & 18.01SC -> Harvard CS50 & MIT 6.042 -> MIT 6.006 -> MIT 6.046 -> MIT 6.036 

The 6.0001 curriculum will be completed in three weeks, and I plan to finish the entire roadmap by the end of 2026 or early 2027.

Note: My goal isn't just to complete these courses, but to truly understand them and retain what I learn.

## 2. Plan Blogging

Do you remember the title of this post?  
It's **#0 Intro**.

**Intro** can mean many things.  
Sometimes it's the **Intro** to a YouTube video.  
Sometimes it's the **Intro** to a movie.  
And sometimes it's the **Intro** track on a music album.

I drew inspiration from the structure of music albums.

Albums typically fall into two categories: singles and full-length albums (everything that's not a single).

Full-length albums usually follow this structure:
> Intro - .. - title track - .. - Outro

#1 python  
#2 Data Science  
....To be revealed later....

## 3. In the Future

My ultimate goal is to implement autonomous thinking in artificial intelligence. I want to recreate the human brain in AI.

I know this is a nearly impossible domain, but that's exactly what makes it so appealing.

I aspire to pursue an EECS PhD.

Even though AI seems like an unreachable limit in mathematics—something we can approach but never quite touch—I deeply respect everyone who conducts research at the forefront of this field.
